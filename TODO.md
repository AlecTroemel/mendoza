# Developer todo list

* One content document -> multiple outputs, or multiple
  content -> one output. Currently, mapping is one -> one.
* MathJax support - we don't need to actually include the script
  and CSS in the output HTML, just markdown support for TeX style
  $ and $$.
* Better internal linking support. Radio linking, anchors, footnotes, etc.
